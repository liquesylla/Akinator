# Akinator
Hello! This project was created as a final project for my introductory computer science class: COMP1405Z. The class was accelerated, so the entire development of the project was condensed into two weeks.
The program is a diluted version of the popular Akinator web game. The program uses user inputted answers to predetermined questions in order to guess who the user is thinking of. 
A detailed report of the project can be found in the https://github.com/liquesylla/Akinator/blob/main/Akinator/MalickSylla_ProjectReport_Comp1405Z.pdf section,
detailing the developmental process as well as key elements of the program's functionality and scope (namely the key system used).
